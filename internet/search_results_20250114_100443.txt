These are protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Essential nutrients are compounds the body requires to perform basic functions and grow. These six nutrients must come from food because the body can’t make or produce enough of them.While there are many essential nutrients, experts break them down into two categories:Macronutrients: These are the primary building blocks of your diet and provide your body with energy. They’re needed in large amounts. Macros comprise protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Micronutrients: These include vitamins and minerals. Small doses go a long way in supporting the health of your immune system, cells, and metabolism, among others. Keep reading to learn more about the six main groups of essential micronutrients and macronutrients.1. ProteinProteins are your body’s building blocks. Protein helps support every cell, from bone to skin, hair, and muscle. It’s used primarily for growth, health, and body maintenance.All of your hormones, antibodies, and other important substances are composed of protein. Your body doesn’t use protein as fuel unless necessary.Proteins consist of different amino acids. Although the body can create some amino acids, many essential amino acids can only come from food. You need a variety of amino acids for your body to function properly.The good news is that you don’t need to eat all of the amino acids at once. Your body can create complete proteins from the foods you eat throughout the day.Learn more about nine important functions of protein in the body.Healthy sourcesProtein can come from a variety of animal and plant-based sources, such as:eggsmeat, such as chicken, pork, turkey, beef, and lambfishdairy productsbeanslegumesnutsAccording to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, protein should make up 10% to 30% of your daily calories. That said, the amount of protein you need daily will depend on several factors, such as your age and activity level.Discover more foods high in protein.2. CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are a key energy source for fueling your body and maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, carbohydrates should account for 45% to 65% of total daily calories.Healthy sourcesThere are two main types of carbs to consider. These could affect your body differently:Complex: These types of carbs fit a well-balanced diet. They take longer to digest and don’t cause as big of a blood sugar spike, which is an important factor if you’re living with diabetes.Simple: These carbs are digested quickly and cause rapid blood sugar spikes. The following table provides some carb sources to consider adding to your diet or limiting:Carbs to eatCarbs to limit• fruits• vegetables• whole grains• beans• legumes• refined grains• candy• pastries• sugar-sweetened drinks• soda• added sugarsLearn more about simple versus complex carbs.3. FatsFats, also known as lipids, are important compounds that help your body absorb key vitamins and minerals. Although fat is higher in calories than protein and carbs, these calories are an important energy source. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that 20% to 35% of your daily calories come from fat, but the World Health Organization suggests keeping it under 30%.Healthy sourcesSeveral different types of fat exist, some of which may provide health benefits while others should be limited. Unsaturated fats are important for your body because they provide essential fatty acids your body can’t make. These fats are found in foods like nuts, seeds, fatty fish, and some vegetable oils.Saturated fats, on the other hand, may increase your LDL “bad” cholesterol if you are consuming too much. They are present in animal-based foods like butter, cheese, red meat, and ice cream, as well as baked goods.Learn more about the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats. VitaminsVitamins play a key role in supporting basic bodily functions. Fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K, are stored in fat after absorption and play a key role in bone, vision, blood, and immune health. Water-soluble vitamins, including vitamins C and B complex, are harder to absorb but play important roles in growth and heart, skin, and nerve health.Not getting enough vitamins may cause health problems and disease. Healthy sourcesVitamins are found in all kinds of foods, including fruits, vegetables, animal products, and whole grains. Eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure you get enough vitamins in your diet. If you think you have a vitamin deficiency, consider speaking with a healthcare professional. They may recommend taking vitamin supplements.5. MineralsMuch like vitamins, minerals help support the body. They’re essential for many body functions, including building strong bones and teeth, regulating your metabolism, and staying properly hydrated. According to the National Institutes of Health, the most important minerals include:calciumphosphoruspotassiumsodium chloridemagnesiumironzinciodinechromiumcopperfluoridemolybdenummanganeseseleniumThese are available in a wide variety of animal and plant-based foods that make up a well-balanced diet, such as meat, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Learn more about 16 foods rich in minerals.6. WaterWater is crucial for every system in your body, and it’s the main thing you’re made of. On average, 60% of your body weight is water. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some health benefits of drinking water include:protecting your nerves and joints maintaining your body temperatureclearing your body from toxinsDrinking enough water may also help prevent dehydration, which could cause constipation, headaches, and fatigue, among other symptoms. Healthy sourcesPlain drinking water is the best water source, but some low sugar, low fat beverages may also help keep you hydrated. Fruits and vegetables high in water may also contribute to your daily water needs.To know if you’re properly hydrated, look at the color and volume of your urine. If your urine isn’t frequent and pale yellow or nearly clear, you probably need more water.The bottom lineSix essential nutrients help maintain bodily functions and promote overall well-being. These include protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.Eating a varied diet full of fruits, vegetables, healthy proteins and fats, and whole grains can help you get enough of these six essential nutrients and more.

April 6, 2023 By Matthew Solan, Executive Editor, Harvard Men's Health Watch The dietary guidelines for Americans say that many Americans don't get enough of four vital nutrients. Over time, a shortfall of these nutrients may affect different aspects of your health, from teeth and bones to your heart, gut, muscles, blood pressure, weight, and more. What is a nutritional shortfall? Nutritional advice can be confusing. Eat more of this, less of that. Make sure you get enough — but not too much. It's no wonder many people have so-called nutritional shortfalls, where their diet lacks sufficient essential nutrients. So, which nutrients do you really need and how much? And what key nutrients do most people lack? The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 offers some insight. Updated every five years by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA, the report found many Americans are lacking in four vital nutrients: calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamin D. According to the guidelines, these four are "considered dietary components of public health concern for the general US population." That's government talk for: these nutrients help you stay healthy, and you probably should eat more of them. Four nutrients you need — and where to find them Here is a closer look at these four nutrients, how much you need, and some of the best sources, per the recent guidelines. The specific daily amounts of each nutrient are based on the recommended daily calorie intake for adult men and women who don't need to lose or gain weight. For example: Women ages 19 to 50 should aim for 1,800 to 2,000 daily calories, and women ages 51 and older 1,600 calories Men ages 19 to 50 should aim for 2,200 to 2,400 calories, and those ages 51 and older 2,000 calories. Of course, specific calorie needs depend on the individual, but these figures offer a reasonable estimate. Food is always the preferred source, as it gives you other essential vitamins and minerals needed for optimal health. However, if you have trouble eating the suggested foods, check with your doctor about whether supplements are an option. Keep in mind that the listed portions for these foods are not recommended serving sizes. But they should help you get more of the fab four in your daily diet. (See this DGA resource page for a more detailed list of foods containing these nutrients.) Calcium How much: 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams (mg) per day Where to find it? 8 ounces of plain, nonfat yogurt: 488 mg; 1 cup low-fat or soy milk: 301 to 305 mg; 1 cup cooked spinach: 245 mg; 1/2 cup tofu: 434 mg. Potassium How much: 4,700 mg (less for people with impaired kidney function) per day Where to find it? 1 cup cooked lima beans: 969 mg; 1 medium baked potato with skin: 926 mg; 1 cup cooked acorn squash: 896 mg; 1 medium banana: 451 mg; 3 ounces skipjack tuna: 444 mg. Dietary fiber How much? at least 28 grams (g) per day Where to find it? 1 cup shredded wheat cereal: 6.2 g; 3 cups popcorn: 5.8 g; 1/2 cup navy or white cooked beans: 9.3 to 9.6 g; 1 cup berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries): 6.2 g to 8 g. Vitamin D How much? 600 to 800 international units (IU) per day Where to find it? 3 ounces salmon: 383 to 570 IU; 3 ounces canned light tuna: 231 IU; 1 cup unsweetened soy milk: 119 IU; 1 cup 1% milk: 117 IU; 8 ounces nonfat plain yogurt: 116 IU; 1 cup 100% fortified orange juice: 100 IU.

People need to consume these nutrients from dietary sources for proper body function.Essential nutrients are crucial in supporting a person’s reproduction, good health, and growth. These essential nutrients are divided into two categories: micronutrients and macronutrients.Micronutrients are nutrients that a person needs in small doses. Micronutrients consist of vitamins and minerals. Although the body only needs small amounts of them, a deficiency can cause ill health.Macronutrients are nutrients that a person needs in larger amounts. Macronutrients include water, protein, carbohydrates, and fats.Keep reading for more information about where to find these nutrients, and why a person needs them.VitaminsShare on PinterestEdwin Tan/Getty ImagesVitamins are micronutrients that offer a range of health benefits, including:boosting the immune systemhelping prevent or delay certain cancers, such as prostate cancerstrengthening teeth and bonesaiding calcium absorptionmaintaining healthy skinhelping the body metabolize proteins and carbssupporting healthy bloodaiding brain and nervous system functioningThere are 13 essential vitamins that nutritionists divide into two groups: fat soluble and water soluble.Fat soluble vitamins are:vitamin Avitamin Dvitamin Evitamin KWater soluble vitamins are:vitamin B-1 (thiamine)vitamin B-12 (cyanocobalamin)vitamin B-6vitamin B-2 (riboflavin)vitamin B-5 (pantothenic acid)vitamin B-3 (niacin)vitamin B-9 (folate, folic acid)vitamin B-7 (biotin)vitamin CTypically, a person who eats a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins can get all the vitamins they need in their food. However, those who eat less fruit and vegetables, and those with digestive conditions may need to take a vitamin supplement to reduce or avoid a deficiency.Find out what vitamins are and what they do here.MineralsMinerals are the second type of micronutrients. There are two groups of minerals: major and trace minerals. The body needs a balance of minerals from both groups for optimal health.Major minerals are:magnesiumcalciumphosphorussulfursodiumpotassiumchlorideMajor minerals help the body to do the following:balance water levelsmaintain healthy skin, hair, and nailsimprove bone healthTrace minerals are:ironseleniumzincmanganesechromiumcopperiodinefluoridemolybdenumTrace minerals help with:strengthening bonespreventing tooth decayaiding in blood clottinghelping to carry oxygensupporting the immune systemsupporting healthy blood pressureA person can ensure they consume enough minerals by including the following foods in their diet.red meats (limit their use and choose lean cuts)seafoodiodized table salt (less than 2,300 milligrams a day)milk and other dairy productsnuts and seedsvegetablesleafy greensfruitspoultryfortified bread and cerealsegg yolkswhole grainsbeans and legumesFurther resourcesFor more in-depth resources about vitamins, minerals, and supplements, visit our dedicated hub.ProteinProtein is a macronutrient that every cell in the body needs to function properly.Proteins carry out a variety of functions, including:ensuring the growth and development of muscles, bones, hair, and skinforming antibodies, hormones, and other essential substancesserving as a fuel source for cells and tissues when neededA person can take in proteins through their diet. The following foods are good sources of protein:red meats (limit their use and choose lean cuts)poultry, including chicken and turkeyfish and other seafoodbeans and legumeseggsdairy productssoynutssome grains, including quinoaAlthough meats and fish tend to contain the highest levels of protein, vegans and vegetarians can get enough protein from various plant products.Learn how much protein a person needs each day.FatsPeople often associate high fat foods with bad health. However, a person needs certain fats to help maintain optimal health.Fats provide the body with energy and help it carry out a range of functions. However, it is essential to consume healthful fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and limit or avoid saturated and trans fats.Healthful fats help with the following functions:cell growthblood clottingbuilding new cellsreducing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetesmuscle movementbalance blood sugarbrain functioningmineral and vitamin absorptionhormone productionimmune functionAccording to recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a person should consume 20–35% of their calories from healthful fats.A person can find healthful fats in several foods, including:nutsfish, such as salmon and tunavegetable oilsseedsFind out the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats.CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are essential to the body. They are sugars or starches that provide energy for all the cells and tissues in the body.There are two different types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. People should limit their intake of simple carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and rice. However, the body needs complex carbohydrates to support the following:the immune systembrain functionthe nervous systemenergy to perform tasksdigestive functionThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a person consumes 45–65% of their daily calories from complex carbohydrates.The following foods contain complex carbohydrates:quinoabrown ricevegetableswhole grain pasta, bread, and other baked goodsoatmealfruitsbarleyPeople should avoid overly processed products that contain bleached, white flour, and foods with added sugar.Learn the difference between good and bad carbs here.WaterWater is probably the most important essential nutrient that a person needs. A person can only survive a few days without consuming water. Even slight dehydration can cause headaches and impaired physical and mental functioning.The human body is made up of mostly water, and every cell requires water to function. Water helps with several functions, including:flushing toxins outshock absorptiontransporting nutrientspreventing constipationlubricationhydrationThe best source for water is to drink natural, unsweetened water from the tap or bottled sources. For people who do not like the taste of plain water, they can add a squeeze of lemon or other citrus fruits.Also, a person can get extra water by consuming fruits that contain a large amount of water.People should avoid getting their water intake from sugary drinks. Sugary drinks include sweetened teas, coffees, soda, lemonade, and fruit juices.Find out how much water to drink to avoid dehydration.SummaryA person needs to consume all six types of essential nutrients to ensure the best possible health. These nutrients support vital functions, including growth, the immune, the central nervous system, and preventing disease.Typically, a person who eats a healthful, balanced diet that includes lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, complex carbohydrates, and water will get the nutrients they need.People with digestive issues, who take certain medications, or have other conditions may require supplements to help them get the body’s essential nutrients.An individual should speak to their doctor about any medical conditions and the medications they are taking before they start to take any supplements. Also, they may want to see a dietitian or nutritionist to discuss their nutritional intake before they begin taking any supplements.Read the article in Spanish.Nutrition / DietObesity / Weight Loss / FitnessHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
